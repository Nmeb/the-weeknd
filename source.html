      <h2>My Story</h2>
      <p>HI! I have been a fan of the weeknd for as long as I can rememeber. Well since 2013 actually. I have always wanted to create
        a fan page since he is my favorite artist. And now I have been <em>Able</em>Able to do that! So thank you so much for taking
        your time to vist mt website and also read this. Like I said I became a fan in 2013. I belive the first song I heard was Often. 
        Well after that I was completley in love with his voice, because it sounded a lot like Michael Jacksons. The song was on repeat 
        for me and well the rest is history.
