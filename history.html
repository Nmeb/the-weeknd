    <h2>Youtube Uploads</h2>
    <p>After dropping out of highschool at the age of 17, Tesfaye always continued exploring his interest in music 
      and began his career in 2009 by anonymously releasing music on YouTube. On Feb. 24, 2011, he uploaded three songs 
      to YouTube under the username “xoxxxoooxo.” No identifying name or photos were associated with the account, other 
      than a curiously misspelled band name: <em>The Weeknd</em>. Two weeks later, one of the songs, 
      <a href="https://youtu.be/sX9DgavXiN4?si=uX50gpc5GaRxWV7O"><strong>What you need</strong></a>, appeared 
      on the notorious indie-music review site Pitchfork as a “Best New Track.”

    <h2>His First Mixtape</h2>
    <p>The Weeknd was gaining attention. Not just because his voice sounded like a reincarnated Michael Jackson, but 
      because of mystery clinging to those YouTube videos was captivating. Everyone wanted to know who was behind this 
      new sound. Within a month, a full free download mixtape was released with the title House of Balloons.

    <h2>His First performance</h2>
    <p>Just 5 months after his YouTube debut, on July 24th, for the first time ever, he performed at the small venue Mod Club in his 
      hometown Toronto. He performed to an eager crowd. Starting things off with his track 'High For This', he's visibly nervous, 
      yet manages to blow everyone away with his sound. He wanted it to be as low key as possible. The flyer of the event stated that there
      were to be no cameras allowd. So that no photos or videos could be taken. Although this didn't work out. As there are plenty photo's taken 
      of him on stage that night and you can watch the full performance on 
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iBpaTahccXw&t=136s&ab_channel=DanayDiggs"><strong>Youtube</strong></a> as well. But his mystery continued 
      with the appearance. Fellow Canadian rapper Drake is also in the audience, and approaches Tesfaye later to suggest the pair work together.

    <h2>Trilogy</h2>
    <p>He then, released two more mixtapes "Thursday" and "Echoes of Silence." The Weeknd decided to gather those two with "House of Balloons" 
      and create his first three-disc album "Trilogy." This helped push his career forward. As he worked with Drake on his 2011 album, Take Care,
      which featured several tracks from House of Balloons, and landed a deal with Universal's Republic Records.
    </p>
    <p>Up until now the artist still refused interviews, nor did he make many other public appearances. But he finally sat down with 
      Complex Magazine. When asked if his " mystery" was intentional, the Weeknd replied: <em>Yes and no. In the beginning, I was 
      very insecure. I hated how I looked in pictures ... I was very camera shy. People like hot girls, so I put my music to hot 
      girls and it just became a trend ... I just ran with it. No one could find pictures of me. It reminded me of some villain sh*t. 
      But you can't escape the Internet.</em>

      released from the Fifty Shades of Grey soundtrack. In 2015, the Weeknd continued his rise to the top with the No. 1 album 
      Beauty Behind the Madness. Specially his disco-pop infused single “Can't Feel My Face,” which could be about a romantic 
      experience or drug use, became for many the unofficial song of the summer, while his ballad “The Hills” also made quite 
      an impression on fans. This well-received record helped the Weeknd rack up an impressive seven nominations for the 2016 
      Grammy Awards, winning for Best R&B Performance for "Earned It" and Best Urban Contemporary Album.
