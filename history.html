    <h2>Youtube</h2>
    <p>After dropping out of highschool at the age of 17, Tesfaye always continued exploring his interest in music 
      and began his career in 2009 by anonymously releasing music on YouTube. On Feb. 24, 2011, he uploaded three songs 
      to YouTube under the username “xoxxxoooxo.” No identifying name or photos were associated with the account, other 
      than a curiously misspelled band name: <em>The Weeknd</em>. Two weeks later, one of the songs, "What You Need," appeared 
      on the notorious indie-music review site Pitchfork as a “Best New Track.”

    <p>Just 5 months after his YouTube debut, on July 24th, for the first time ever, he performed at the small venue Mod Club in his 
      hometown Toronto. He performed to an eager crowd. Starting things off with his track 'High For This', he's visibly nervous, yet manages to blow 
      everyone away with his sound. But his mystery continued with the appearance. 
      Fellow Canadian rapper Drake is also in the audience, and approaches Tesfaye later to suggest the pair work together.

    <p>Up until now the artist still refused interviews, nor did he make many other public appearances. But he finally sat down with Complex Magazine. 
      When asked if his " mystery" was intentional, the Weeknd replied: <em>Yes and no. In the beginning, I was very insecure. I hated how I looked in 
      pictures ... I was very camera shy. People like hot girls, so I put my music to hot girls and it just became a trend ... I just ran with it. No one 
      could find pictures of me. It reminded me of some villain sh*t. But you can't escape the Internet.
    </em>
