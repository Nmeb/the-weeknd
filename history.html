  <h1>Who is the Weeknd?</h1>
  <img src="imgs/history1.jpg" >
  <h2>Early Years</h2>
  <p><strong>Abel Makkonen Tesfaye</strong>, known professionally as <strong>the Weeknd</strong>, 
    is a Canadian singer, songwrite and record producer. He was born and raised in Toronto Ontario 
    and is the son of Ethiopian immigrants. His early musical influences ranged from traditional Ethiopian 
    music to the <em>King of Pop</em>, <strong>Michael Jackson</strong>. In an interview with Vanity Fair, 
    the Weeknd specifically cited the impact of Jackson's 1979 hit "Don't Stop 'til You Get Enough," describing 
    it as "the song that helped me find my voice. It's the reason I sing.”

  <h2>Youtube</h2>
  <p>After dropping out of highschool at the age of 17, Tesfaye always continued exploring his interest in music 
    and began his career in 2009 by anonymously releasing music on YouTube. On Feb. 24, 2011, he uploaded three songs 
    to YouTube under the username “xoxxxoooxo.” No identifying name or photos were associated with the account, other 
    than a curiously misspelled band name: <em>The Weeknd</em>. Two weeks later, one of the songs, "What You Need," appeared 
    on the notorious indie-music review site Pitchfork as a “Best New Track.”
